  (** There are two components in the representation of a transition: its {i
      transform}and its {i guard}.  The transform maps each variable that is
      {i written} during the transition to a term over its input variables.
      The guard is a formula that describes the condition under which the
      transition may be executed.  The set of variables that appear in the
      transform or the guard are called the {i footprint} of the
      transition. *)

      (** Test whether two transitions are equal up to logical equivalence and
      renaming skolem constants.  The input transitions must be normal in the
      sense that (1) the transform only assigns skolem constants to terms
      (e.g., we may have [x := x'] with guard [x' = x + 1], but may not have
      [x := x + 1]) and (2) every skolem constant that appears in the guard
      also appears in the transform. *)
